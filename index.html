                <p>
                    Hello there! My name is Máni Fay and I am a novice writer who specializes in fantasy, romance, poetry and the
                    occasional thriller. At Mani Fay's Fiction, my goal is to provide you with enriching content that will
                    enrich your mind. Before diving into my works, let me introduce myself. I am an avid reader of romance, fantasy,
                    and historical fiction. Apart from writing (which is quite obvious), I also enjoy journaling and drawing,
                    hobbies I have had since I was in third grade. I have interests in photography, playing the ukulele,
                    psychology, and Japanese culture. Although my first language is American English, I prefer to spell "gray"
                    as grey. Grey with an "a" just feels so wrong to me... Anyways, I am currently learning Spanish and can participate
                    in basic conversations with others who speak the language. I also have beginner-level coding skills and created
                    this website myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, I am a cat person. Just look at this little guy!

                <p>
                    With all those details said and done, I bet you want to know what I can do for you as a reader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have the ability to make your dream worlds a reality, write a heartfelt poem for you or your significant other,
                    create an intriguing article, and much more! Of course, all of these services come with a price and specific
                    conditions, but you can easily view the "Commission Details" section to see the costs and what I can offer. To get
                    an idea of what I can do and how much it would cost, you can check out the "Stories" and "Poems" section for some
                    simple examples. If you're interested in contacting me or following my social media accounts (which include book
                    reviews, drawing sessions, and storytimes with gaming), simply head over to the "Contacts/Socials" section.
